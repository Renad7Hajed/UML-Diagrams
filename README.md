# UML-Diagrams

In this task that talks about UML diagrams, I prepared two types of these diagrams, which are (Deployment Diagram) to explain the elements of the robot in detail, and then I prepared (Use Case Diagram) to explain the scenario that will happen between the user and the robot in addition to the admin. The main goal of preparing this task is to explain to all members of my team the new scenario, which is for the robot to add content on social networking sites and interact with them. I hope the diagrams are clear to everyone.
